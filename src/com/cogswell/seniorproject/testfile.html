Buffet system is slightly different to other restaurants in a way that they serve items to you in a sequence. This is good in a way that you don't have to leave your table but at the same time you don't have the liberty to eat any item as you want (as they serve in a sequence once each item and you have to ask if you want the item again). In terms of the menu for buffet, there weren't many but adequate and we were happy with them.

Nothing great. The attitude to the staff and management should improve a lot. I was there for dinner on 04/29/2018 around 9:45 PM and witnessed a heated argument between a patron and a person claiming to be the owner. The patron was a pregnant lady. \n\nI do not know the reason behind the argument but the tone and the words of the owner were unacceptable. His body language was extremely aggressive and kept saying \"you should have the sense, we can't do anything\" etc. \n\nThe lady could be in the wrong in this particular scenario, but I would prefer not to go to place where the owner thinks he could talk down to his customers. This is not an isolated incident, my friends have had not so good experience here, ranging from wait staff being reluctant to serve additional side dishes and purposely delaying service as a payback for previous complains.\n\nNo more Pista House"</td><td><img src="powered_by_google_on_white1.png" alt="Google" align="center"> &nbsp; </td></tr></div><tr><td>★★★★★</td><td width = "200" height = "50"> "I loved the place.
