There was about a 5-minute wait though, but it was a little busy at the time.

I was pleasantly surprised by the food options here, including ramen! We ordered a bucket of their popcorn chicken (seasoned in garlic and basil) and I ordered a taro bubble milk tea (made with fresh taro, not powdered).  \n\nWhen I came another time though, they forgot my order. Not a good experience second time around."</td><td><img src="powered_by_google_on_white1.png" alt="Google" align="center"> &nbsp; </td></tr></div><tr><td>★★★★</td><td width = "200" height = "50"> "This place has good beverages and always busy. If you're coming here for ramen always keep in mind that 3p-6p is down time for it. It's available before and after those times.\n\nFor first timers, grab their Hokkaido milk tea or red bean milk tea if you're looking for a creamy nibbly beverage."</td><td><img src="powered_by_google_on_white1.png" alt="Google" align="center"> &nbsp; </td></tr></div><tr><td>★★★★★</td><td width = "200" height = "50"> "I love this place because they have many selections of tea. The popcorn chicken is to die for. Just a little disappointed that it went up in prices but it is worth it. Parking js a  little suck."</td><td><img src="powered_by_google_on_white1.png" alt="Google" align="center"> &nbsp; </td></tr></div><hr></body></html>
