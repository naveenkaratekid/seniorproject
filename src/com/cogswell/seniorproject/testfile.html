This so-called manager stood nearby could clearly hear our conversation and when I said so that’s been sitting there all along and we been waiting, he quietly said it just came out and barely made eye contact and said nothing else did and apologize and make sure he stay distant from the situation he should’ve jumped right into from the beginning and rectified. I live right up the street and by the time we got her food it was all completely cold and disgusting, definitely way overpriced for the garbage that you get, their appetizer that supposed to be some kind of cracker with guacamole and hot sauce on it could’ve been good if it wasn’t all nasty and soggy from sitting there, we also ordered samosas which I thought besides being cold were really good, we also got wings that I thought could’ve been great but we’re just cold with lots of sauce on it and super soggy no one wants to soggy wing.I understand things happen and most the time I give people a second try, but not this place, there’s nothing worse than bad customer service and a manager that doesn’t care at all, you guys might want to rethink who you have as the face of your restaurant and who you have dealing with your customers or who you have that’s not dealing with them."</td><td><img src="powered_by_google_on_white1.png" alt="Google" align="center"> &nbsp; </td></tr></div><tr><td>★★★★★</td><td width = "200" height = "50"> "Indian style food brought to you in a very new concept.
