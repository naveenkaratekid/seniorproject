<h3>Reviews</h3><p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★★★★★ : "I went here for a business conference, so everything I dealt with was outside of having a hotel room or getting room service. The cafe is a little pricey (which is to be expected), but the food is good! However, I went just before the local Grand Prix so it was a little difficult to find the entrance with all the construction around for it. Parking is pricey if you’re attending an event there, they do not validate or offer a discount on their parking. But there is a lot of local places to eat and lots of places to shop, catch a movie, see the marina, etc. all within a 5-10 minute walk! Conveniently located and the place was well kept and the staff very nice and attentive!"</p>
<p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★★★★ : "Lovely hotel. Large and spacious. Used for conferences of all sizes and by universities. A truly international mix of customers of every age. Coffee shop and gift shop next to reception. Concierge service excellent. They organized our tours within minutes and held our luggage until we were ready to leave. Heated pool outside used by all ages well into the night with a charcoal fire and easy chairs. Lovely atmosphere. Open dining room downstairs. Large complex of shops and eateries walking distance across the motorway.  Rooms are spacious, well air-conditioned with tea/coffee amenities. Bathrooms are well appointed good pressure power shower, complimentary toiletries."</p>
<p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★★★★★ : "This is a great hotel. While checking in the staff went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and happy. The room was great, very clean and modern. It had a fantastic view of the harbor as well as the gran prix that was going on. The breakfast was great, pricy but all the food was excellent. I'd come here again anytime."</p>
<p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★★★★ : "Very nice place. Good places to visit that are walking distance. Would have have been nice if DVD players were available for in room down time. Bathrooms would be better of they had fans and the doors weren't semi-see through glass door"</p>
<p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★★★★ : "I came to a wedding reception at the Hyatt.  The decoration, setup and quality is on the higher end.  I'm guessing you pay anywhere between $65-$85 per guest.  I think that it is a good option to have your wedding party here.  However, wedding party guests do pay full premium for parking.  I'm giving four out of five because they could have more people working."</p>

<h3>Reviews</h3><p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★ : "Location is great BUT hotel itself is overrated and a DOWNER. \n\nInstructions of room is not placed properly and I moved an item to read a label that read, “Items moved from these shelves will be immediately charged to your room.” They get customers by accidentally moving an item so that the sensors can charge you.\n\nIn consequence, I moved an item to read a label that instructs the person NOT TO move an item to avoid a charge.\n\nThis and the hotel does not have a personal microwave. Mini fridge HARDLY HAS ANY SPACE. How can a hotel like this not have basic appliances but have a sensor to charge customers for moved products?\n\nYou’re better off finding another hotel with better room service, bigger room, and better guest conveniences.\n\nIf you’re looking for a hotel that is Guest-Oriented, you NEED to find a different hotel.\n\nI mean room looks nice, but everything else is ridiculous."</p>
<p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★★★★★ : "Cody, Atticus (our corgi) and I thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Centric Long Beach.  The room was super comfortable and large for a city hotel.  The location was awesome.  We especially appreciated the amazing service from all involved but, in particular the bartender.  Her authentic and thoughtful attentive care lead us to spending a few hours enjoying your lounge.  We are excited for our next visit!"</p>
<p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★★★★ : "Wins huge points for: free room upgrade, water machine in reception, good shower, swivelling TV, huge bed, and location. Loses tiny points for: check in (we could barely understand the guy - so quiet!), housekeeping (came very late in the day). Overall this was a win, and we'll be back."</p>
<p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★★★★ : "Had to hunt down their valet service. To park and to pay. Other than that beautiful hotel. Clean and well decorated. Modern."</p>
<p><img src="powered_by_google_on_white_mini.png" alt="Powered by Google" align="left"> &nbsp; ★★★★ : "Nice eclectic hotel. Rooms and furniture are small. Bathrooms and beds are big and nice. Parking is a pain - either $21 a night valet or $16 a day park yourself across the street in the outlet mall garage -no attendant. Keep track of your ticket! Rooftop views are great. Restaurant is nice - but $$$ - French toast & coffee plus breakfast burrito & juice = $45. And, of course, mini fridge items are ridiculous. They suggest you have grubhub bring you food - interesting, but we never had dinner there. \n\nThey may have aquarium pass available and they have free sunscreen at the desk!!"</p>
