<p>★★★★ : "Good place to grab a snack, but it is small and does not house a lot of people at one time. The staff are friendly and fairly reliable."</p>
<p>★★★★ : "I ordered a dark roasted oolong tea with 50% sugar and 30% ice and it was pretty good; dark, but not too bitter, and just the right amount of sweetness. There was about a 5-minute wait though, but it was a little busy at the time. I would definitely come back here again next time I am in Milpitas."</p>
<p>★★★★ : "This place has good beverages and always busy. If you're coming here for ramen always keep in mind that 3p-6p is down time for it. It's available before and after those times.\n\nFor first timers, grab their Hokkaido milk tea or red bean milk tea if you're looking for a creamy nibbly beverage."</p>
